				<p>Students - the swimming pool is free of charge to all Imperial students.</p>
				<p>Staff - staff are required to pay a fee per swim or join Club Imperial and pay a monthly fee. Staff who are not Club Imperial members can use the swimming pool, sauna, steam room and spa for £6 per visit. If you are a regular swimmer, even if you only swim once a week, our Club Imperial membership scheme will give you more value for money.</p>
				<p>Children - children are not permitted to swim, except during familyswimtimes, from 09.00 - 11.00 on a Saturday or Sunday and accompanied by an adult member for £3, or as part of FastFin lessons or a school. Children must be with an adult, if the child is 8 or older and a competent swimmer then adults may watch them from the viewing area.</p>
				<p>To access the pool, you will need a ticket from reception, which you will be required to show the Recreation Assistant on poolside.</p>
